      <pre>
Who thought it could've been like this for all i wished gone
Who thought it could've changed into a stranger's look away
I remember, I remember seeing you for the first time.
I remember walking up puzzeled trying match perfect things
I remember last time the happiness and pain.
I remember whats all left just memories (now memories)
So why can't i lose all the momories now, why can't i
So much sacrificed for left by unwakened dream
I'm trapped in this sordid game, where the ending's
                                          All the same


I tried to heal your heart with all that i could
                              But got mine broken instead
Ever since the day you left my fate been set alone
Tell me how many years to walk this path alone? (again)
So much we planned ahead, so why'd you choose to leave
                              Why cant i?
Nothing is harder than to wake up all alone, Realize
    it's not okay, it's the end of all we known
Time keeps passing by but its seems frozen still
Tell me do you still even feel a thing?
Scars are left behind but some too deep to feel
And i've lost my power to feel anymore
Gave you all i had to give, i hope its worth it

When all is gone and can't be regained
    We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
The pain is strong and urges rise, your pain is gone
Time shows now I think I understand my mistake
Like a memoir i saw it through, In the end
                        I'd give my life for you.
Once i stood so tall now i'm searching for a sign
Nothing lasts forever for all good times we had
    I'd choose to trade it all to bring you back
Some day, some-day when you'll open your mind
You'll find a mistake that dragged us all behind
Non' can't be real, u took a piece of me with you.
Cause' If you'd only see the picture's clear as today, 
                        you'd still be around

Oooh I can hear the voice's wanting you to stay, 
    I suppress them voice's cause' ain't gonna be the same 
They say all love can never die, I say it just moves on
Oh, i don't need your regret apologizes. Save it for another time
Cause we all just need a reason, a reason to stay
But some can't be bothered to stay for another day
Oh I ain't worried about anything no more
Cause' there's somebody that will love us all
But if we can't be in no relationship with this person and 
    make it work
How you gonn' go be in another relationship and 
    make it work, it's the same thing


It's the end of the road, the last chapter remains
Found a place for you in my mind, where you can stay away
Everything can finally fade, I hope you find your own way
What's left to find, the big prize wasted and the days are gone.

                                           <b>Thank you, Good-bye</b>
