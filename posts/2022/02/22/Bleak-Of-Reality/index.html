<h1 id="everything-and-nothing">Everything And Nothing</h1>

<p>One night in a dark side of a room, somewhere ultimately unknown.A young
man laying in his bed thinking of ways he could’ve escaped his fate,
trying desperately to change his own bleak of reality, lost in endless
thoughts that keeps him awake throughout the night. As he was about to
sleep he heard a strange whistle sounds coming from out of his house, as
he wore his sleepers and went to the balcony to take a glimpse. A bright
red light from above the sky flashes his eyes leaving him blind as he
falls to the ground unconsciously.
He woke up at sunrise in a strange place stripped from his clothes with
nothing but an underwear and a blanket, not knowing where he’s or how
got there made him scared and confused. He sat for few minutes trying to
process what just happened but with no thoughts nor an explanation he
eventually stood up and decided to find some help, he climbed up a hill
with his bare feet for over thirty minutes till he was able to reach the
top. He spotted a farm that was little far from the hill he was in,
fortunately climbing down wasn’t painful as going up. He kept walking
and walking thinking its getting close but time and hunger wasn’t in his
favor, everytime he looks at the farm it gets closer but as soon as he
takes his eyes away it goes back further and further. It was like
torture but it was all the sun’s surface reflection. By the time he
reached the farm it was already the evening, while being on a empty
stomach the whole day felt like days without eating or drinking
anything, he felt weak and sick and was barely holding.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/farm.jpg" alt="image" width="500" /></p>

<p>A farmer with his family saw him at the fence waving for help, they
quickly approached the young man as they got to him he collapsed under
the weight of not holding anymore.They took him in treated his wounds
and let him rest for as much time he wants. He woke up the next day on a
fresh set clothes and a warm bed but still on a empty stomach, he turned
his head few times looking at structure of the house thinking “<em>What is
this place?</em>”, it looks like a 1000 years old, he got out of his room
exploring the place, till lady of the house found him in a daze and
brought him to where everybody was gathered around a polished wooden
table. The farmer’s family was small it consisted of him and his wife
and his two daughters, one of them is at his age and the other one was
little older, <strong>Elgin</strong> “The farmer” asked:</p>

<p>“<strong>Elgin</strong> : What’s your name son?”</p>

<p>“<strong>Boy</strong> : my name’s... “ “[being confused]{.medium} “</p>

<p>“<strong>Boy</strong> : my name’s is Arye”</p>

<p>“<strong>Elgin</strong> : What happened to you?”</p>

<p>“<strong>Arye</strong> : I don’t know, all i remember is my name”</p>

<p>“<strong>Arye asked</strong> : What is this place, where are we?”</p>

<p>“<strong>Elgin</strong> : This is northern east of <strong>The United Empire</strong>” <em>Arye</em> went
into a shock, believing this is all a dream and he would soon wake up.
But he couldn’t he became frustrated and almost went insane, even trying
to cut his hand with a knife as a resort thinking it would woke him up
but that didn’t work and soon found out it wasn’t a dream.</p>

<h1 id="raise-and-fall">Raise And Fall</h1>

<p>The continuous couple days, <strong>Arye</strong> stayed with the farmer’s family as
he had no place to go,he kept thinking of the possibility of how such
thing could happen to him, realizing all the people he knew and love are
all gone and there’s no way he could’ve meet them again, all the dreams
and adventures he wanted to do are now part of his memory. <em>Arye</em> gave
up and eventually understood there’s no chance for him to expect a
miracle, he began to think of how he should live his new life and to
make a future. On the other hand the farmer’s family couldn’t kick
[Arye]{.underline} out of their home as they had empathy for him for not
having anyone. They provided him with a spare room in their house in
exchange he would help [Elgin]{.underline} in farming which he warmly
accepted.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/house.jpg" alt="image" width="500" /></p>

<p>The farm house was a long thatched house, consisting of a kitchen, 3
bedrooms and parlour. All bedrooms were occupied, one for the farmer and
his wife, another for his two daughters, and the last was given to
<em>Arye</em>. His bedroom had a nice little feather bed with two sheets and a
blanket with a drugget quilt. The parlour room was where they spend most
of the time together, its walls were papered and had a nice polished
wooden table at the center with six horse hair chairs and a plain little
sideboard at a side wall. There was a nice fireplace with mantelpiece,
over which hung a small mirror. <em>Arye</em> gets up at five o’clock wear his
breeches,shirt and a vest with some boots and waits for <em>Elgin</em> in front
of the house, they don’t take breakfast till they come back at 7
o’clock. Elgin and Arye open up the barn to let the sheep and cows go
out, while Arye keeps an eye on them. Elgin visits the closest village
market to exchange goods, mostly butter and eggs as vegetables and
fruits grow in the farm. He comes back later around 6 where Arye locks
the animals around the fence and they both go back to the house where
breakfast will be served. In the parlour table, lady of the house put a
cellar full of salt on the table and a big mug of skimmed milk, and a
knife for each person in the house, then cooks the eggs that Elgin
brought back from the market.They all sat down, <em>Elgin</em>,his <em>wife</em>,and
their 2 <em>daughters</em>, and lastly <em>Arye</em>. After everyone ate their fill,
Arye and Elgin go to the field while one of his daughters go milk the
cows and the other checks and waters the garden and lady of the house go
down to the field to dig potatoes for lunch and dinner as she brings
with her my ass and cart to lift what was harvested in the field as it
was heavy work.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/homing_machine.jpg" alt="image" width="500" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile Elgin trying to teach Arye how to use the <em>Hay tosser</em> Machine
to harvest corn and <em>Mowing</em> Machine to seed corn, tomatoes, at the same
time. In that moment Arye stopped and thought about how different life
was. He felt free from everything, no more thinking about problems just
living the life as its gonna end tomorrow. As both kept working
<strong>Weseel</strong> the younger daughter of <em>Elgin</em> brought them a hot beverage
of <strong>Leek Milk</strong> that she her self made the other day. The way she hands
the bowl to <em>Arye</em> as he looks up at her eyes while their hands collide,
both made an invisible bubble as the heart’s glow and time slows down.
What was a 2 seconds felt like eternity. As Elgin didn’t notice nothing
around him, Weseel quickly took off to the farm house while Arye kept
thinking about that moment while working. Few hours later <strong>Aurore</strong> the
older sister of <em>Weseel</em> came up to the field to tell them that lunch is
ready to be served. Meal was scarce at that time as there was an arid
climate at some seasons, but potatoes were plentiful. They had lunch at
12 and dinner at noon. Dinner consisted of boiled potatoes, cabbage and
tomatoes and rarely sometimes bacon, and at around 5 o’clock <em>Rice Milk</em>
is given, sometimes in the fields, but more often in the kitchen.
Supper, like breakfast, consisted of rice, and buttermilk with some
smashed potatoes.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/aryeweslee_in_field.jpg" alt="image" width="500" /></p>

<p>Days pass and everyday while <em>Arye</em> is working, <em>Weseel</em> would came up
to him in the field to bring him something new she cooks, they’ve never
talked or said a word since the first day, they would just look at each
other with a smile as they bend space and time to their own well.
They’ve kept it this way for months, till one day close to midnight
<em>Arye</em> got out of his room and headed to the kitchen to drink some
water, at the way in suddenly <em>Weseel</em> appeared in front him he didn’t
know what to say and thought about not disappointing <em>Elgin</em> as he
trusted him, let him in his house and made him one of the family. But as
well didn’t want to lose another chance, he grabbed her hands pushed her
close to the wall. As he experience her soft, voluptuous, wet lips
slowly approaching. Perceiving her warm, sweet breath, foreseeing the
moment they will touch his. Her big, beautiful, brown eyes can hardly go
unnoticed, while simultaneously his hands experience the disconcerting
feeling of her smooth skin. Her intoxicating scent can only be rivaled
by the overwhelming yearning of her forbidden taste and the breathtaking
play of her tongue. Miraculously everyone was asleep as both slowly
enjoyed every single bite of their long waited love.<br />
The next day as <em>Arye</em> was putting down a great big pot of turnips to
scald for the horses in the barn, <em>Weseel</em> takes the chance, comes to
him and says that she wants to meet him here at night. After everyone
had their dinner that night and went to bed, <em>Arye and Weseel</em> waiting
hopelessly for midnight to come, Arye gets up first and goes to the barn
while Weseel patiently waiting for her sister to fall as asleep. The
moment <em>Aurore</em> slept, <em>Weseel</em> snuck out of her room quietly and went
to <em>Arye</em> where they laid down in the barn, as both express their love.
<em>Arye</em> descries a look of strength, convicting, and determination to
overcome any impediment to their ability to be together, he felt gifted
as they kiss and cling together while simultaneously looking at the
stars. Meanwhile <em>Aurore</em> woke up and didn’t find her sister, she
searched where she might be at but couldn’t find her as she gets closer
to the barn she hears whispering only to find out <em>Weseel</em> And <em>Arye</em>
lying around in the barn. <em>Aurore</em> decides to keep it as secret and goes
back to her room pretending to sleep, waiting for <em>Weseel</em> to come back
but falls asleep minutes later. In the morning as everyone gathered
eating breakfast, <em>Elgin</em> told <em>Arye</em> to come with him to a Western city
and it would take them at least 3 days. While <em>Arye</em> packs his bag
<em>Weseel</em> secretly joins his room, kisses him and hands him a piece of
her clothes as she whispers in his ears <em>“Come back to me soon, I love
you.”</em>.</p>

<p>In their journey,<em>Elgin</em> and <em>Arye</em> stumbled upon many villages and
bought many items, <em>Arye</em> asked for what purpose are they going for as
most of the items are for a special event. <em>Elgin</em> replied that he’s
getting ready to make a wedding for his daughter <em>Aurore</em> and he’s going
to get some fancy clothes from the Western side. <em>Arye</em> unintentionally
out of nowhere asked <em>Elgin</em> if he would somehow let him marry <em>Weseel</em>
but just before he could’ve answered. They reached the front gate of the
city, the people were protesting and the whole situation there was out
of hand. It turned out <strong>The United Empire</strong> just declared war against
<strong>The Reunions Empire</strong> for attempting to invade their land, and now
they are preparing to draft over 500000 men for war.\</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/draft_war.jpg" alt="image" width="500" /></p>

<p><em>Arye</em> worst fears of joining the war became real as he and <em>Elgin</em> both
got drafted. The devastation and fear broke him so badly, he refused to
believe so and blamed his bad-luck for turning his dreams upside down
again. They gave him a sword a uniform and ammunition to reload the
canon when its needed as there was no time for training while <em>Elgin</em>
was put in the middle line for his beneficial structure and his previous
experience in war. <em>Arye</em> spent sleepless nights in the wild waiting for
the other part to strike, whilst thinking of <em>Weseel</em> and how afraid she
must have been all this time, notwithstanding the distance and time
hoping he one day still will be able to see her. <strong>The Reunion Empire</strong>
ambushed silently at midnight with their huge fleet at the western
shore, the first line guarding were slaughtered in cold blood as few
escaped to spread the word of their trap, <em>Elgin</em> and his fellow
soldiers were getting ready to put on an attack against the empire’s
army it consisted of 3 troops of cavalrymen commanded by 3 captains and
it had between 30 to 100 men, most of them where operating independently
setting at front line with artillery and were managed by soldiers like
<em>Arye</em> himself. The empire troops arrived close by the gate at around 3
o’clock in the morning, taking heavy cannon balls and stroked with
arrows despite that they had an army in front gate of two hundred
thousand men out of nine hundred thousand. They didn’t had a chance,
soon enough <em>Arye</em> was hit in his shoulder as a foot soldier with a
musket that was a typical long gun with metal ball shot him as it nearly
almost killed him. He fell on the ground as life was about to end,
desperately trying to get up thinking of his life flashing in front of
his eyes. Till he remembered he hasn’t done with life yet, he pulled the
piece of clothes that <em>Weseel</em> gave him realizing its all he got left.
Marvelously twisted it around his shoulders, whereas pain just
unexpectedly disappeared. He got a dead gunner firearm and started
fighting like a man and for the ones that matter, he shot 8 of enemy
troops that night. The fight continued till sunrise and both armies fall
back as casualties are increasing by thousands. <em>Arye</em> phenomenally
survived with a wound but was able to recover from it and was later
united with <em>Elgin</em> as <strong>King spence</strong> did a memorial burial for those
who died in the line of duty, and honored <em>Arye</em> and others for their
heroic fight against <em>The Reunions Empire</em>. The war temporarily stopped
as both sides rushing to unite with other kingdoms to go against each
other in final deadly battle. Meanwhile <em>Arye</em> and <em>Elgin</em> go back to
the farm after their departure that lasted over 2 months.<br />
When both arrived to the farm, <em>Arye</em> first thing he did was to find
<em>Weseel</em>. Just as he spotted her in the field he dropped his bag and
sprinted as fast as he could, as she sees him from far away running
towards her brings up tears and joy, they hugged and kissed for what
feels like eternity its because of their love saved them both and
brought them back together for another chance, during that time <em>Elgin</em>
cheers up with his wife and daughter <em>Aurore</em>, moments later <em>Arye</em> and
<em>Weseel</em> come back to the farm house she hugs her father and the whole
family sits around the table to take dinner, <em>Elgin</em> starts telling
stories about the battle and how <em>Arye</em> almost died at the same time how
brave he was during that time, <strong><em>Elgin</em></strong> looked directly at <strong><em>Arye</em></strong>
and said <em>“There’s nobody i would trust more my daughter with other than
you”</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/wedding.jpg" alt="image" width="500" /></p>

<p>The next couple days the whole family was getting ready for <em>Aurore</em>
wedding night, they’ve prepared everything from clothes,food and a huge
tent in front of the house. Whilst waiting for the husband’s family
<em>Arye</em> and <em>Weseel</em> sit together in a rounded table, discussing when
their marriage will take a place and what to name their 4 children and
the big house they will have to built to fit in a whole new family.
<em>Aurore</em> wedding started at 9 o’clock with her husband’s family bringing
gifts and jewelry, as everyone flip over and dance as never before, in
which way <em>Arye</em> and <em>Weseel</em> join in after drinking for the first time.
Everyone spent a glorious night that day.<br />
The farm house now shrank in members as <em>Aurore</em> has left with her
husband, <em>Arye</em> and <em>Elgin</em> continued working on the farm specially the
fields while <em>Weseel</em> and her <em>Mother</em> took care of other things, such
as the cows and the garden. One day a messenger visited the farm house
asking for <em>Arye</em> as he passed down a letter from <em>King spence</em> saying
that was he looking for brave men from around the kingdom, he signed him
as a knight and a commander and has to come back to the western city.
<em>Arye</em> totally refused so but he cannot go against the king’s word. He
made a promise to <em>Weseel</em> that he will be back and he would marry her
as soon as he’s over with his duty. <em>Arye</em> took off riding a horse to
the king’s castle and was welcomed with honor and respect, he was given
a chamber to where he would stay, the king would gather all this
commanders including <em>Arye</em> to consider possible options of winning the
war, while many gave their strategies and ideas <em>Arye</em> proposed to just
end the war by both sides signing an agreement and finishing this
political debate once for all. The king’s first choice of going to war
was a total lose, as he lost half of his army just in the first battle
realizing if he put up another one, its gonna be his last and for his
kingdom. He thought about it wisely and picked <em>Arye</em> to be his right
diplomatic hand. A week later, <em>Arye</em> with <em>King spence</em> meet up with
<em>The Reunions Empire</em> king to negotiate on their terms, to not invade
others land and keep it peacefully between both sides in return they
will unite together and help grow their kingdoms by any means necessary.
Surprisingly both agree and sign the agreement the same day. On the way
back <em>King spence</em> asks <em>Arye</em> to moves back to the castle with him
permanently considering he would cover up his wedding and provide him
with a place for him and his wife, <em>Arye</em> happily accepted his offer
hoping <em>Weseel</em> would also agree to live in the palace. He returned few
days later to the farm house being welcomed with love from <em>Weseel</em> and
his [father]{.underline} in law <em>Elgin</em> and his <em>wife</em>. <em>Arye</em> came back
to fulfill his promise and to marry <em>Weseel</em> he proposed to her to get
married in the palace in the western city and to live there, while being
shocked from what she hears. she agreed saying it was all girls dream to
step in the palace but to get married and live in it was something way
beyond imagination.\</p>

<p>They packed everything they needed in the next day and headed straight
towards the western city, they arrived in the castle where <em>Arye</em> showed
them the place and took them their rooms. The wedding was set to be 2
days later, the servants brought luxuries clothes and jewelry and made
beautiful wedding dress for <em>Weseel</em>.</p>

<p>The day he dreamed about is finally happening, from finding the love of
his life to getting a life he never expected but was able to get he felt
grateful and happy but not as happiest as he was on the wedding day. As
everyone in hallway waiting for the pride to come out while he stands
impatiently, she comes out in her white stylish dress looking a like
princess, his eyes filled with tears of joy and love for her as she
stand next to him while everyone is cheering. As now they are wife and
husband <em>Arye</em> kisses <em>Weseel</em> and take her for a romantic dance as both
look at each other knowing they’ve accomplished wonders. In that night,
after the wedding ended and everyone went to sleep the palace was
attacked by troops of <em>The Reunions Empire</em> where they betrayed the king
as a result he and his wife were killed while <em>Arye</em> helplessly tried to
save <em>Weseel</em>, but the castle was surrounded and there was no way out,
they didn’t want to die separated so they went to the roof as both
hugged and kissed each other for one last time and ultimately jump to
their fate..<br />
<em>Arye</em> woke up in a hospital bed with tears in his eyes unable to
process what happened, as the doctor approaches and tells him he has
been in a coma for the past 6 months. It cracked him up so badly he
couldn’t differentiate between whats real anymore everything he saw and
experience was just a dream. Till thirty minutes later a black haired
girl that looks exactly like <em>Weseel</em> enters his room and hugs him he
couldn’t believe his eyes, nevertheless, the incident he had made him
suffer from a temporarily memory lose and as soon as she started talking
to him, he remembered she was the girl he loved all this time. He
quickly learned that nothing was lost, he was given a chance again to
start a life as he dreamed of all this time, he got out of the hospital
a week later. Knowing his purpose and starting from scratch, he got
married few years later with the same girl and both had big family of 4
children as they lived happily after.</p>
