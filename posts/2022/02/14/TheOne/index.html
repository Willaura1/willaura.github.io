<h2 id="sec:org134120c">The Only One</h2>

<p>Long time ago, 4 years precisely a boy met a girl they were both
strangers and young, with lot less common interest, they’ve talked a lot
shared things about themselves to a point where they were not strangers
anymore, a point where friendship began .</p>

<p>Days after days, Weeks after weeks, Months passed friendship became a
relation with no boundaries both grow feelings for each other. Just
thinking about it gives me goosebumps, it wasn’t normal it was built
different like no matter how you think about it, it really felt
different a thing that i have never felt before .</p>

<p>The boy suddenly fell in love with this girl. he never felt so much joy
and happiness than ever, everything in life turned to be good and
positive as it was but with more creativity and lot more energy. “<em>life
was empty until you came and filled it with love.</em>” The time he told her
about how he felt about her brought excitement and chemistry as an
unforgettable moment, her reaction was priceless i can’t express it
surely but she did really love it. It was until somewhere in July where
she told him that she have feelings for him. Could you think of how he
felt at that moment, the adrenaline that was bumped in his blood veins
directly to the heart. Put a huge smile on his face and enlightened his
life they were the happiest in the whole world. The connection both
created together was strong not publicly breakable and didn’t include
any weaknesses or other factors that might ruin it, and it remained this
way for over a year and half .</p>

<p>Unfortunately every relationship had plot-hole somewhere theirs was just
coming. The relationship they had was long distance and that itself was
a reason to break it down, no matter what they do or talk about things
became boring and that made it lose its spirit, it was all falling
apart, he was falling apart, he couldn’t keep up anymore. He was
devastated,depressed . Eventually they broke up, the strangest possible
way of breaking up. The boy’s first week made him feel nothing at all it
was normal but as soon as time was running out. A feeling of
loneliness,contrition,woefulness squashed him hard like broken branch
from a tree .</p>

<p><br />
Life was back again normal with more changes, as it turns out when life
hits you hard you overcome it or you fall into the trap, but that was
not it for the he focused more on the things he liked and was worth it
and it turned out perfect for him, he felt happy and energetic .<br />
Just Before The moves away from the city, he spotted her from far away.
Of course nothing serious he just continued with his day and then he
spotted her the next day and the day after it, and it was weird because
you start questioning why this is happening? there might be a reason or
a purpose or is it just pure coincidence!</p>

<p><em>Who is this girl who almost broke the unbreakable laws of nature?</em> We
can call her <strong><em>Lily</em></strong> because she’s a princess partially, everything
about her is interesting and exciting. She’s a big dreamer and a fan of
watching tv series also she’s special a lot, a girl that you won’t find
in your life like a lot maybe if you’re lucky because she’s the type
that is very rare. What made her so extraordinary is that she possess
some of great traits of all with her <em>Big Heart</em> and <em>Generous Spirit</em>.<br />
She shows her true self and speaks the truth sincerely even when it’s
easier to lie. She lives a life of truthfulness – one that’s free from
deceptions. The way she thinks and acts is always in line with her
values and morals. Her warm energy and being able to laugh at silly
things make her great to be around. She doesn’t criticize when you make
mistakes, bring up a hurtful past, nor hold a grudge.She forgives
sincerely, learns from the situation, and moves forward without hatred
in her heart.Her presence is comforting, and she can manifest good
health to make those she care about feel better. And when it comes to
love, her nurturing side brings out the best. In particular, she knows
how important meaning, purpose and respect is in relationship. She
attracts unconditional love for she gives it freely as bringing out the
best in others … Yet that’s not even a tip of an iceberg, the fun
thing about <strong><em>Lily</em></strong> is that its hard to anticipate her she’s sort
of a mysterious girl which makes her really exciting.<br />
Little i know about <strong><em>Lily</em></strong> is her personality that i love the most
being warm,kind and friendly. She’s not too talkative but she is able to
talk and be friendly with strangers besides she’s very
intelligent,passionate and an excellent conversationalist. She can be
stubborn at times but that’s all part of her being adventurous as well,
willing to take risks and constantly proving to be loving and caring at
the same time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I saw you and thought, “Man, she’s perfect.” Then I knew you were not perfect—and that made me love you even more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>In an attempt to describe you more, i realized i was lost at words for
such endeavor. I hopelessly sat in front of my laptop, absently glancing
at its uninspiring keyboard, without knowing what to type. Trying to
find them in a dictionary would aslo be a futile attempt, for I wouldn’t
know what to look for. Notwithstanding, the specification of the task
seems simple enough —imagine someone who’ve never been in love with
you… now proceed to communicate the exact feeling one would have.</em></p>

<p><br />
The boy knew such thing because he was able to recall with meticulous
detail the moment he realized that the oath he repeated to himself so
many times - that he would <em>not</em> fall in love with the girl - would be
utterly impossible to hold. “<em>After so much time both unaware of their
existences one should brought them back <strong>Fate</strong>.</em>”<br />
While both them are far away a force beyond makes the boy’s mind
absently going through the unforgettable captured moments. As an amused
thought procedes that hesitated message of hers - “Hi!” - while she
simultaneously choose the next sequence of notes to be echoed throughout
the conversation, chaining back the unbreackable chain. The boy resign
himself to contemplate your intoxicating existence, drawning a faint
smile from who’s head is running a thousands of kilometers per hour,
speeding through roads of endless thought. “<em>It is not without irony
that events chain like this without purpose</em>”<br />
Couple of weeks later, While both skim through the set of photos that
will forever preserve in print that scented, young images of yours, “I
nonchalantly - almost - that i have never quite realized how beautiful
you were. However, it is now to my surprise that this assertion
postulates a lie. The truth resides in the fact that at that precise
moment, sitting in this chair, nothing is so obvious, nothing is so
axiomatically true as that very same proposition; you <em>are</em> perfectly,
flawlessly, gorgeous.”<br />
The instant she entered energetically and cheerfully back into the boy’s
life, as someone who’s fallen for the bittersweet taste of life. The
thoughts the boy have pondered on the possibility to someday hold you
tight in his arms, lost amongst moisten sheets due to the ample sweat of
the hours that insist running by both… and he would have certainly
laughed in disbelief by the extreme improbability of such an exquisite
event. But, it seems that not even all the rigorous products of bayesian
factors are able to forcast the surprising <strong>fate</strong> of those who wander
throughout this delightful and absurd existence.<br />
And from nowhere after a long time in between everything, he found you,
innocently between his arms - While I attentively watch you sing
joyfully and without refrain, deeply and anxiously inhaling all life
surrounding your being, Your big brown eyes dance, sparkle, and jiggle
around imaginary objects painted the same color of the next tune you
choose to listen… … when the aformentioned moment comes; where i
inadvertently - perhaps unwillingly - glance over your voluptuous lips
while you eat, certaintly designed with the sole purpose of making
myself loose so helplessly in them. And with a swift and impromptu
attitude, an absolute silence rushes to surround me… and the beating
of my heart is suspended for what seems like eternity… my legs tremble
beneath your precious body.<br />
And you, so steeped in that contagious happiness, might have just missed
that moment where you became the reason for forever holding this slice
of spacetime within me. Thus after such fruitless struggle, I’m forced
to conclude that no sequence of words or chains of symbols could ever be
used to faithfully fit into such unbreakable connection… and likely
the reason is due to the fact that only in their absence can one begin
to contemplate of whats more to come …\</p>
