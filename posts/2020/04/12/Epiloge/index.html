      <p><strong>* The Rebirth…</strong>*</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two words as nonthreatening as words come. But put them together side-by-side and they have the power to haunt you for the rest of your life:…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sixteen days went by since you’ve made the decision of leaving her. Yet, you still haven’t found the courage to write the exact words — or perhaps those that you <em>remember</em> — that were said during that afternoon. Likely because, once again, even if every fibre of your being knew that <em>that</em> was the only possible path, you kept <em>hope</em>, as always, that the world would show you things <em>could</em> be different. And, in that last breath of hope, you’ve let — you’ve <em>forced</em> — her to be the one saying out loud what both knew to be the purpose of that meeting, that day, that conversation, that last embrace. There’s no place for <em>pride</em> in the game of love, and the only way for you to approach the certainty you were looking for was, <em>once again</em>, to put in her hands the decision of both of your fates.</p>

<p>And ever since, those words haunt your days, your dreams, your unconscious mind. You recurrently ponder every hypothesis, every past decision where things could have been different. Perhaps if — at <em>that</em> time, at <em>that</em> point, when <em>she said what she have said</em> — <em>you’ve</em> reacted differently. If at least you’ve tried to be more <em>understanding</em>, more <em>tolerant</em>, less <em>worried</em>, more <em>disconnected</em>… If you’ve had the courage, or the patience, of <em>giving time to time</em>…</p>

<p>That hateful sentence… That concept that seems to be against everything that defines you, that defines what you’ve learned to <em>be</em> in these past years, so against the human condition. <em>Time</em>, our worst enemy, simultaneously the source of our existence — no one exists as an <em>immutable being</em> — and our doom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We live on the future: “tomorrow”, “later on”, “when you have made your way”, “you will understand when you are old enough”. Such irrelevancies are wonderful, for, after all, it’s a matter of dying. Yet a day comes when a man notices or says that he is thirty. Thus he asserts his youth. But simultaneously he situates himself in relation to time. He takes his place in it. He admits that he stands at a certain point on a curve that he acknowledges having to travel to its end. He belongs to time, and by the horror that seizes him, he recognizes his worst enemy. Tomorrow, he was longing for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it. - Albert Camus</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet, without time, there is no hope, for:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A man devoid of hope and conscious of being so has ceased to belong to the future. - Albert Camus</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from this realization, <em>deliberately</em> or not, your mind decided to do what it does best every single day: to <em>analyze</em> the situation, to <em>ponder</em> the alternatives, to <em>create</em> solutions, to <em>test</em> hypothesis; if the solution doesn’t work, if the hypothesis doesn’t hold, then one has to simply backtrack, to ponder where it went wrong, to look for the <em>detail</em> that eluded us; because something eluded us… something <em>always</em> eludes us:</p>

<p>And if it really becomes necessary, then you scratch everything, you throw all away and start from the beginning! Yet another course of action that comes so easy for you; something that would scare so many people or be simply regarded as a complete waste. But not to you; you never hesitate in throwing away hundreds of hours of work. Why? Because nothing is lost: nothing is <em>ever</em> lost! You <em>always</em> keep something… the experience of failing, the knowledge of what doesn’t work, the intuition that leads you to join point A, with point B, with point C… <em>but that missed something along the path</em>; the frustration that keeps you moving, and the tenacity that there is no problem that cannot be solved… because the solution always existed — <em>somewhere</em> — and if it is currently out of your reach, it’s because <em>you, and only you</em>, don’t possess the <em>skill</em> to find it. The responsibility always felt down over the one and same person, and you’ve learned — or <em>today you choose</em> — that there’s no gain in sharing it with others. You are, simultaneously, the victim, judge, and executioner of your own failures.</p>

<p>But life isn’t made of that stuff; because would you think carefully, would you observe yourself writing down this text, would you contemplate the long sequence of actions, the chain of events that lead to the existence of tens of thousands of words dedicated to someone you hardly understood — someone that was probably nothing more that the <em>idealization</em> of your own mind — you would see that <em>control</em> is a mere illusion, and any attempt to <em>comprehend the incomprehensible</em>, the neverending quest for the meaning of life and the sensations that make us happy, are themselves the ultimate acts that impede us from being so:</p>

<p>What is then left to us, mere humans, also incapable of controlling that arrow of time?…</p>

<p><em>Choice…</em></p>

<p><em>The choice</em>, free of every and any illusion of consequence and meaning. We are not able to control the world or the people that surround us. We cannot bend reality to our own will. But we are — <em>we believe to be?</em> — able to choose.</p>

<p>And that now depart from each other, due to the action of the exact same force that once attracted you… perhaps still looking onto one another, taking with you whatever both <em>choose</em> to take. While one of you, unable to forget all the wonders that were seen and felt in such a different, such fascinating, such strange but simultaneously such familiar world, forever revolted by the <em>unshakeable laws of nature</em>, ponder:</p>
